**SOME INFO ABOUT FILES-**

* main.py- contains two function test and predict ,predict function returns list of characters

* all_functions_used.py - it contains all the necessary preprocessing functions used for processing image

* character.txt- it contains charcterset on which model was trained

* model.h5- ML model which was trained for predicting character 

* requirements.txt- contains versions of all the libraries and packages required for running the file  

* prediction_test_images-contains test images on which model was successful in predicting correct word

* segmentation_test_images-contains images on which script was successful in segmentation


**STEPS FOR RUNNING-**

* Just give the correct model path and run the main.py
* You can train your own model and use it with this python script.

**Features of our model-**

* 1.It can handle rotated word, angle<80degree
* 2.It can work on blurry images
* 3.It can work on images with shadows and background noises
* 4.The only necessary condition for model to work is slight space between characters
* 5.Size of character set is 21
